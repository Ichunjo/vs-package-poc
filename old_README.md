# AWarp

AWarp filter modified from https://github.com/dubhater/vapoursynth-awarpsharp2.


## Parameters

```py
awarp.AWarp(vnode clip, vnode mask[, int[] depth_h=3, int[] depth_v=depth_h, bint mask_first_plane, int[] planes=[0, 1, 2]])
```

- clip: Clip to process. Any format with either integer sample type of 8-16 bit depth or float sample type of 32 bit depth is supported. Clip can either have the same dimensions as `mask`, or four times the size of `mask` in each dimension. The latter is useful for improving subpixel interpolation quality. Upsampled clip must be top-left aligned.

- mask: Edge mask. Must have the same format as `clip`.

- depth_h/depth_v: Strength of the warping. Negative values result in warping in opposite direction, i.e. will blur the image instead of sharpening. Subsampling factor will be applied to second and third plane if not specified.

- mask_first_plane: If True, the `mask`'s first plane will be used as the mask for warping all planes. The mask will be bilinearly resized if necessary. Defaults to True for YUV color family, False otherwise.

- planes: Specifies which planes will be processed. Any unprocessed planes will be simply copied, except when `clip` has four times the size of `mask`, in which case the unprocessed planes will contain uninitialised memory.


## Compilation

```
meson build
ninja -C build
ninja -C build install
```
